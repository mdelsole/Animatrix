"""
Working memory is the "next step" after a stimulus has been processed by its respective hierarchy.

If sufficient attention (i.e. sufficient activation of dopamine receptors) is directed towards the stimulus, stimulus 
is inputted into working memory

"""

# Working memory means the activity of the high-level neurons that represent the stimulus (AIT neurons) persists.
# Persistance continues until disruptance


# A piece of information in working memory can be shared with other regions


# Given sufficient circumstances, the memory in working memory is transferred to long-term memory (hippocampus)
